I would like to keep the GoPro camera in the Tarot Gimbal all the time. Even for charging or downloading the images the videos and images via USB. But so far I always had to take the camera off the Gimbal as it was impossible to connect the USB cable. The reason is that the Tarot Gimbal blocks access to the USB port on the GoPro. This is very annoying.

In this post I will show you how to use a small and lightweight (less than 1g) angled Mini-USB adapter to solve this problem.

**Required materials and tools**

The following materials are required. Below are direct purchasing links for Amazon.com:

  * <a href="http://amzn.to/2eFegv3" target="_blank">Motorola Right Angle Charger Adapter Mini-USB &#8211; SKN6182</a>

The following tools are required:

  * None

**How-to assemble**

Follow these steps to use the angled Mini-USB adapter:

  * Connect the Mini-USB adapter to the GoPro camera.
  * Mount the GoPro camer to the Tarot T-2D Gimbal.

**Results**

The final result of the mounted Mini-USB adapter will look like this:

I keep the adapter on the GoPro all the time and it allows me to charge it as well as download videos without taking of the GoPro.

As an alternative you can remove the outer plastic casing of the Mini-USB adapter via a sharp knife. This way you can remove the Mini-USB adapter when not needed &#8211; e.g. during flying &#8211; without having to remove the GoPro camera.
